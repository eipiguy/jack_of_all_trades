## Testing Framework

This is a prime candidate for unit test based-development. It's simple, and easy to do everything from the command line.

Set up a set of unit tests and baselines to cover the current functionality:
- following suit
- finding trick winner
- dealing cards
- play progression
- trick change
- game change

New functionality can come once theres a testing system in place. That will make it easier to add new features anyway.
